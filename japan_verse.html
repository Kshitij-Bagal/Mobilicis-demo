          <label>The Japanese language orders words differently than English.</label>
          <div class="fact-body">

          <div class="fact-body">

          <label>From the 12th century to the demise of feudalism in the 19th century, the samurai were a powerful warrior class in Japan.</label>
          <div class="fact-body">

          <div class="fact-body">
            <img src="Resource/bow.png" alt="Bow">

          <label>The kimono is a traditional Japanese garment worn by both men and women.</label>

            <p>Known for their elaborate hairstyles and white makeup, geisha were considered symbols of beauty and grace. The white powder covers most of the geisha’s face and neck, though unpainted spaces creating a W shape are usually left on the neck, which is considered alluring.</p>
